## User Guide

### Site-wide settings

Fields under `[Params]`

Site description.

#### mainSections

-   Type:`[string]`
-   Default:`['story']`

Pages places under this/those sections will be shown on homepage and archive page.

In order to use a language, set `DefaultContentLanguage` to the language code in the configuration file.

-   `en` English
-   `zh-cn`Chinese (Simplified)

For example, if you want to use English, set `DefaultContentLanguage` to en.

### Post Structure Format

Create a `memo` folder inside the `content` directory, where the normal Markdown (.md) article files will be placed:

```
hugo new content/memo/1.md
```

Site Parameters Configuration

```
[Params]
  mainSections = ['story','memo']
```

If you want to use a different alias, you can do so by replacing `memo` with the alias of your choice.

### Card list category archive template

To use a template for your desired page, such as for the `travel` category, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `content` directory in your file system.
2. Create a new file called `_index.md `within the `categories/travel` directory. This file will represent the main page for the `travel` category.
3. Open the `_index.md` file and add the following content:

```
---
title: Travel
layout: travel
---
```

Save the file, and you’re done. The template named `travel` will be used to render the `travel` category page.

Make sure you have the necessary templates and configurations in place to support the `travel` layout.

Please note that `travel` is the category slug. To display a separate category name, you can customize the title in the front matter of the `_index.md` file.
