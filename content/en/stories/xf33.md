The XF33mmF1.4 lens is currently one of the most difficult lenses to buy in mainland China. It is basically out of stock everywhere online, and even pre-orders come with a price markup.

I originally planned to publish this article at least during the Singles’ Day shopping festival, but unexpectedly, it was published much earlier. The main reason is that this lens is simply unavailable, and it’s impossible to buy, even with pre-orders requiring a price markup. A while ago, I sold two lens adapters on a second-hand marketplace. Occasionally, I would check the marketplace, and I happened to come across a seller in Beijing offering this lens, which they purchased during the June 18th shopping festival. They even registered it for extended warranty. After a brief conversation, I decided to buy it. If it weren’t for finding this seller, I almost bought a brand new 35mm f1.4 lens, but this lens is old, dating back 10 years, and even the most bizarre coincidences couldn’t keep it going.

Currently, I have three lenses with a 58mm filter thread size. I only purchased one original manufacturer UV filter, and I also have a B+W filter. The B+W filter might be better in terms of quality, but I prefer to pair my lenses with the original manufacturer filter because at least the color of the filter’s frame matches the lens.

This lens may not have the same stunning appearance as the XF56mm lens, but when held in hand, it gives a solid and sturdy feel. The aperture ring feels tight and has a mechanical sensation when rotated, which I really like. Apart from the automatic aperture lock button on the aperture ring, there are no other buttons. It would have been great if there was a switch or dial for changing the focusing modes.

The lens comes with a plastic cylindrical lens hood, which I personally prefer over the petal-shaped ones. However, I still purchased an original manufacturer square lens hood, and instantly felt the weight increase. I worry that a minor accidental impact could result in a dent or damage. Another thing to note is that the lens hoods for the 23mm and 33mm lenses are interchangeable, but the number on the hood is 23. For those with a touch of OCD, this can be quite bothersome, haha.

Looking at Fuji’s X-mount lens roadmap, it doesn’t seem like there will be any new lenses in the coming year or two. I hope they will release something similar to the Voigtlander 13mm f/1.4 in the future. It’s a bit disappointing that third-party manufacturers are leading the way.

As for the specifications, I’ve already introduced them. I’m not usually focused on specs, but I’ve been using this lens almost exclusively for the past two weeks, so I’d like to share my personal experience. When paired with the original lens hood, the lens becomes much shorter, giving it a less intrusive feel when I’m out shooting on the streets. In the past, when I used the XF56mm lens for street photography, I was mistaken for a commercial photographer by security guards. The linear motor autofocus is quiet and fast, allowing me to capture shots seamlessly from picking up the camera to pressing the shutter button. I’m quite satisfied with Fuji’s achievement in this aspect. The focal length, equivalent to a 50mm lens on a full-frame camera, feels comfortable to use. It doesn’t distort when shooting vertically, making it great for food photography, as well as for everyday outings and meals.

All in all, the flaws do not overshadow the strengths.
