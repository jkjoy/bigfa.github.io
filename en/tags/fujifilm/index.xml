XF23mm F1.4 R LM WR Now whenever I use a 35mm lens, I have this image in my mind, with a strange sense of sadness.
Years ago, when I was using Olympus, I bought a prime lens that was roughly equivalent to 35mm. I didn’t choose this focal length because I particularly liked it, but simply because it was affordable.</description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF33mm F1.4 R LM WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf33/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:55:59 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf33/</guid><description>XF33mmF1.4 R LM WR The XF33mmF1.4 lens is currently one of the most difficult lenses to buy in mainland China. It is basically out of stock everywhere online, and even pre-orders come with a price markup.
I originally planned to publish this article at least during the Singles’ Day shopping festival, but unexpectedly, it was published much earlier. The main reason is that this lens is simply unavailable, and it’s impossible to buy, even with pre-orders requiring a price markup.</description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF56mm F1.2 R WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf56/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 18:59:07 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf56/</guid><description>Fujinon XF56ｍｍF1.2 R WR Recently, I bought a lens mainly because the low-light performance of my X100V was poor. When I pick up the camera at night and want to quickly take a photo, it’s highly likely to come out blurry or have a lot of noise if I increase the ISO. When I didn’t know much about Fujifilm lenses, my first choice was the XF50F1.0 because of its large aperture.</description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF18mm F1.4 R LM WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf18/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 09:34:23 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf18/</guid><description>富士 XF18mmF1.4 R LM WR Actually, I received this lens before the XF56 Mark II, but I didn’t use it much and didn’t take many sample photos. I always felt that this lens had greater potential, so I took it out last weekend and took some shots. However, I realized that it was just the same as before, and I ended up with only a few photos for this article.</description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF 90mm f/2 R LM WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf90/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 14:22:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf90/</guid><description>XF90mmF2 R LM WR Fuji has a relatively niche lens, and it’s also quite old. The second-hand price is around 4000, but usually, it has been used for a long time. The original price is too expensive, so I ended up finding a refurbished one through official channels. It has a minor defect with a small dust particle, but it’s tolerable. When I purchased the XF 56, I mentioned that the focal length was not quite enough.</description></item></channel></rss>
